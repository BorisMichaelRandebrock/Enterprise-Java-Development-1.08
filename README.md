## IntArray vs IntVector Efficiency

The difference regarding its efficiency of the IntArray list and the IntVector depends on whether the arrays used are using a larger or smaller amount of Integer numbers.

Initially, and for a smaller amount of numbers, the intArray would be the prefered option since it does use less memory spaces by incrementing only by 5% the file size.

If, on the other hand the amount of numbers is large, than the IntVector would be preferrable since it would have be more efficient since its incrementation rate per loop is 100%.
